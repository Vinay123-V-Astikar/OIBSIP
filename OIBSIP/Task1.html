                <h1>PHOTO STUDIO</h1>
                <p>The history of photographic studios and photography dates back to the 1840s with the invention of processes for recording 
                    camera pictures, by Henry Fox Talbot and Louis Daguerre. The earliest photographic studios made use of natural daylight to 
                    create photographic portraits. As already used by artists, a northern light with no direct sunlight was favoured.

                    The first use of a "flash" dates back to 1839 when L. Ibbetson used limelight to photograph very small objects. Limelight was 
                    produced by placing a piece of lime into a flame fuelled with oxy-hydrogen. Photographic studios started using flashes in 1840
                    and in 1864 the next technological breakthrough, magnesium wire, became the new artificial light source. However, not 
                    everyone could afford it as they were quite expensive and dangerous. These flashes were also known as 'hot lights' and could
                    have exploded. By 1860s they were in common use in professional studios. 'Tungsten Lights' or 'Hot Lights' were still in use.
                    Around the 1870s even smaller studios got access to flash lights or strobes.
